# Radix Primitives Cheatsheet

I love [radix primitives](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives) but I find the documentation a bit difficult to work with. The `Anatomy` section for each component fails to present a minimal use-case because it lacks content and necessary styles, while the glossy example presented at the top of each page is too verbose to quickly see what's going on.

This cheatsheet is intended to show at a quick glance, what is necessary to make each primitive perform its intended function.
