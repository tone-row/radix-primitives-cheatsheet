I love the components offered by [Radix-UI Primitives](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives). I wanted to lower the bar to using them for myself and others by providing a quick reference for the most common use cases. This cheatsheet is intended to show the minimum content, props, and styles needed to make each primitive perform its intended function.
